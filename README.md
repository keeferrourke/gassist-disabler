# Google Assistant Disabler / Now on Tap restorer
This Magisk Module disables Google Assistant on Nougat Google Pixel ROMs by
making a modification to the build.prop. Google Now on Tap functionality is
restored as a result of this process.

## Instructions
  1. Disable Google Assistant in Google Now settings.
  2. Install the module in Magisk Manager.
  3. Wipe data from the Google App.
  4. Reboot to recovery and wipe cache and Dalvik/ART cache
  5. Restart your device.

## But why would you do this?
Google Assistant somewhat sucks, and lacks a lot of features that Google Now on
Tap had. These features include OCR, and other screen capture features that
made searching screen content easier, as well as the ability to do things
without yelling at your phone.

## Warnings
This module does the exact opposite of what [Google Assistant Enabler](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/Google_Assistant_Enabler) does. They are not compatible.
